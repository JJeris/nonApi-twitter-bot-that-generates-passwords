# twitter-bot-generate-password
This is a twitter bot that: generates a password, posts its on its own, personal, twitter account and does this at a designated time. This project is meant to showcase my ability to automate something on the web, using python to do it.

You can view the project in action at @JJerisGenPwBot twitter.
